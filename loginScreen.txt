1. Return type **int
2. first call loginScreenMenu() - func just to display user options
3. ask for input:
-1. sign in,
-2. sign up,
-3. exit,
4. if -1 call fuction for signing in with return type **int
5. if **return number > 0 pass true to return of loginScreenMenu
6. if **return number = 0 let user try again.
7. if -2 call functions for signing up which will add User to userList via pointers and store changes in file.
8. if -3 pass **number 0 to return of loginScreenMenu

*probably will have to add -3 change user name -4 change user password -5 exit shifted here.

**return type has to be int and function needs to return user Id so we can pass it further into AddressBook
